                <p>Not just an existential crisis!</p>
                <p>I'm a front end web developer based out of central California with a passion for
                    Javascript. I primarily specialize in React but I'm always learning new things 
                    for practical and personal applications.

                    <h3>Who have I worked with?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>I've worked primarily with non-profit organizations.<br>
                    <img src="Media/Skybrook logo.png" alt="Skybrook Foundation"> <br>
                    <br> My first work was with a small (now defunct) organization called
                    the <b>Skybrook Foundation</b> The foundation primarily focused on spreading
                    awareness for a disease called Sarcoidosis. My duties primarily boiled down
                    to writing the entire web platform from scratch. I primarily did it as a favor
                    to a friend of mine and as a means of training my skillset the best I could.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="Media/vuee logo.jpg" alt="Vuee" class="big"> <br> <br>
                    The next place I worked was on a site called <b>Vuee.io.</b> This ultimately didn't work out
                    because the work environment was entirely unprofessional and the platform was unpolished.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="Media/ole logo.jpg" alt="Open Learning Exchange"> <br>
                    The most recent organization I worked with I had to leave due to large family troubles: <b>Open
                        Learning Exchange</b>. This organization (if you haven't heard of it) primarily makes a fantastic
                    open source education system for use in impoverished countries. My duties mainly boiled down
                    to catching and fixing bugs, however due to the previously mentioned family issues I didn't
                    accomplish much before I had to leave.
